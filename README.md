# üî¨ Social Innovation and the Energy Transition in Iran

This project explores the role of **social innovation** in facilitating the **energy transition** in Iran, combining **quantitative and qualitative methods**. The research draws inspiration from leading countries such as **Germany** and **Japan**, and applies data-driven approaches leveraging **Python**, **machine learning**, and **data analysis** skills.

## üìå Research Objectives

1. Promote citizen and community engagement in energy consumption management through social innovation.
2. Identify institutional, social, and cultural capacities and barriers in Iran.
3. Understand how social innovation can optimize energy consumption.

## üß™ Methodology

### 1. üìà Quantitative Analysis: Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA

- **Goal**: Analyze long-term trends in energy production and consumption and forecast key indicators.
- **Method**: ARIMA time series modeling on historical energy data (2000‚Äì2023).
- **Tools**: `Pandas`, `Statsmodels`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`.
- **Indicators**: 
  - `renewables_share_energy` (share of renewables),
  - `energy_per_gdp` (energy intensity),
  - `fossil_share_energy`.
- **Forecast**: 2024 to 2030.

### 2. ü§ñ Machine Learning: Clustering & Predictive Modeling

- **Clustering**: `K-Means` to group countries based on energy profiles and compare Iran to Germany & Japan.
- **Prediction**: `Random Forest`, `Gradient Boosting` to predict renewable energy share based on:
  - `population`, `GDP`, `solar_consumption`, `wind_consumption`, `hydro_consumption`.

### 3. üîç Comparative Analysis: Case Studies

- Compare policy frameworks, energy cooperatives, and innovation initiatives in Germany & Japan.
- Combine quantitative energy indicators with qualitative data from:
  - IEA, IRENA, Energiewende reports.

### 4. üìö Qualitative Review: Role of Social Innovation

- Study successful cases (e.g. Germany‚Äôs cooperatives, Japan‚Äôs community programs post-Fukushima).
- Identify enablers and barriers to local participation in energy transition in Iran.

## üìä Dataset & Tools

- **Dataset**: `"owid-energy-data.csv"` (Our World in Data)
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `Pandas` for data handling
  - `Statsmodels` for ARIMA
  - `Scikit-learn` for ML models
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` for visualization

---

## üîó Research Integration

Final results integrate:
- Forecasts & trends from ARIMA models
- ML-based insights and clusters
- Case comparisons and qualitative analysis

### üéØ Outcome

Provide actionable recommendations for Iranian policymakers to:
- Empower citizens and local communities,
- Build a resilient and efficient energy system,
- Leverage **social innovation** for sustainable development.
